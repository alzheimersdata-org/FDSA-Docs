### Q1. What is a federated data sharing application?

A federated data sharing application is a platform that enables multiple organizations or entities to securely and collaboratively share data while retaining control over their own data sources. It allows decentralized data sharing without the need to centralize all data in a single repository.

### Q2. How does the federated data sharing application work?

The application operates on a peer-to-peer model, where each participating organization maintains its data locally and establishes secure connections with other partners. These connections facilitate the exchange of data while adhering to privacy and security protocols.

### Q3. What are the main benefits of using a federated data sharing application?

- **Enhanced data privacy:** Organizations can control access to their data, ensuring that sensitive information remains within their boundaries.
- **Decentralized governance:** Each participant maintains autonomy over their data, avoiding a single point of control.
- **Improved collaboration:** Facilitates cross-organizational data sharing and collaboration, fostering innovation and insights.

### Q4. What types of data can be shared through this application?

The application supports sharing structured data (database - PostgreSQL) now. There are plans for unstructured data (text, documents), and even multimedia content (images, videos), depending on the platform's capabilities, industry demand, resources, and cost in future releases.

### Q5. Is data security ensured in a federated data sharing environment?

Yes, data security is a top priority in a federated data sharing application. The system employs robust encryption, authentication mechanisms, and access controls to protect data during transmission and storage.

### Q6. How is data ownership managed in the federated model?

Each participating organization retains ownership of its data. The federated data sharing application facilitates secure access and usage of data by authorized entities without transferring ownership rights.

### Q7. Can I control who accesses my organization's data?

Absolutely. The application provides fine-grained access controls, allowing you to specify which organizations or users can access specific data sets and under what conditions.

### Q8. Is the federated data sharing application compliant with data protection regulations?

Yes, the application is designed with data protection regulations in mind. It allows organizations to adhere to relevant data protection laws while exchanging information with other entities.
