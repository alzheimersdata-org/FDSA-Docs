## Installation Steps

> **Note:**
> - If you intend to use an external database instead of the default/local one, refer to the section 'How to use an external PostgreSQL DB for the internal FDSA management' before proceeding.
> - To install behind a load balancer, please first read 'How to install behind a load balancer.'

1. Start the root user mode:

   ```bash
   sudo su
   ```

2. Ensure the installation directory exists:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /var/www
   ```

3. Navigate to the installation directory:

   ```bash
   cd /var/www/
   ```

4. Clone the release repository from one of the following options:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:alzheimersdata-org/federated-data-sharing-appliance-releases.git
   ```

5. Enter the 'federated-data-sharing-appliance-releases' directory:

   ```bash
   cd federated-data-sharing-appliance-releases
   ```

6. Copy the '.env-template' and rename it to '.env':

   ```bash
   cp .env-template .env
   ```

7. Copy your SSL certificates to the 'ssl-certs' folder:

   ```bash
   cp -f <PATH_TO_YOUR_CERT>/fullchain_certfile.crt ./ssl-certs/fullchain_certfile.crt
   cp -f <PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>/private_keyfile.key ./ssl-certs/private_keyfile.key
   ```

8. Start the appliance and complete the required fields:

   ```bash
   bash ubuntu-startup.sh host.example.com
   ```

After the installation is completed, you will receive your Root credentials as an output on the console.
