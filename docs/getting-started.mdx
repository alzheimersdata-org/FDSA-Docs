title: Getting started
description: Welcome developer here you'll start to setup FDSA
---

## Objective

This page steps through the process of running an instance of FDSA, for development or testing.

## Pre-requisites
To run the server in development, the following need to be in place:
- Ubuntu Linux 18.04 or latest
- `curl` and `jq` can be useful for testing API calls on the command line
- Docker
- Python 3.9 or greater - Anaconda python is a convenient basis for this

## Run the server in development mode:
Following are the instructions to run the project in dev mode.

### 1. Change to the GIT branch you want to run
Use GIT to switch to the branch you want to run.
```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Example: `git checkout fdsa-new-ui`

### 2. Set up the environment
Copy the `.env-template` file to a new `.env` file and check the parameters.
```sh
cp .env-template .env
```
To replace a previously existent `.env` use:
```sh
cp -f .env-template .env
```

Make sure the environment variables in the .env file looks like this:
```
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Environment mode
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FDSA_VERIFY_SSL=1
SEND_EMAILS='False'
ENV_MODE='dev'
```

### 3. Generate self-signed certificates for HTTPS
Execute the `add_certificates.sh` script:
```sh
bash add_certificates.sh
```
> Note this only needs to be done once. In subsequent runs, jump to next step.


### 3.1 (Optional) Open test database ports to access through DBeaver

1. Go to the `docker-compose.yml` file
2. Look for the fdsa_db service and map the ports `- 5555:5432` below the `expose` line as I did below:
   ```yml
     fdsa_db:
       ...
        expose:
          - 5432
        ports:
          - 5555:5432
       ...
   ```
3. Once the FDSA is started, you'll be able to connect to the DB by using the following credentials:
   ```
   host: localhost
   port: 5555
   database name: fdsa_appliance
   user: pguser
   password: pgpass
   ```

### 4. Build and run the docker containers for server using the startup script:
First make sure you don't have any processes on the reference ports (i.e. Apache, PostgreSQL) which would interfere
with the docker ones. If you are a first time runner, run `docker login` with credentials provided by the dev team.

```sh
bash startup.sh
```
When completed the superadmin password will be promted in the terminal.

At this point, by default the server will be accessible on https://localhost.
You can see the server status at the health check endpoint using `curl` and `jq`:
```sh
curl -k https://localhost/api/common/v1.1.0/health_check | jq
```
> Note `-k` is added to avoid verifying the self-signed certificates. It should be removed in production

**You can now go on your browser to `https://localhost/admin`, register the first admin and start using the appliance**

Please note that the env template assumes `localhost` will be your fully-qualified domain name. If you want to use a custom
domain name, modify the `FQDN`, `KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME` and `FDSA_BASE_URL` variables in the script.

### 5. (Optional) Run the [integration smoke test](../smoketest.sh)
Which tests some basic functionality is working:
```sh
bash smoketest.sh --stdout
```

## 6. Cleaning up
Once the server has been built and run, it can be stopped using the `uninstaller.sh` script:
```sh
bash uninstaller.sh
```

## 7. Development
It is recommended to install a virtual environment inside `api` to run the tests and development.

```
virtualenv venv -p python3.10  # only if you don't have a virtualenv yet
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e fdsa_backend # only needed if dependencies have changed
pip install pytest pytest-env
```

### Running unit tests

Running the unit tests only requires a test database.

1. Go to `/api/fdsa_backend/tests`.
2. Run  `docker compose up -d` to start the test database or use a local Postgres DB of your own, based on the pytest.ini file.
3. Go back to `/api`, and run the following command:

```
pytest
```

Or `pytest <test_name>` to run a specific test, e.g. `pytest test_validation_helpers.py`.


### Using pre-commit hooks
For a development environment it is recommended to use pre-commit hooks:

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This will automatically run some standard checks to your commits.
The same checks will be performed in CI, so it's easier to run on pre-commit.
