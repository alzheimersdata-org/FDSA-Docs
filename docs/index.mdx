## Overview

The Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative (ADDI) is a global coalition of leading academic, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations that have come together to help researchers discover and share data, access analytical tools, and collaborate on studies. The Initiative removes silos by enabling seamless access to interoperable data sharing platforms, unlocking important Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) datasets, and fostering research collaboration through a community of researchers and data scientists who can work with and learn from one another.

The AD Data Initiative's flagship product, the **AD Workbench**, is a cloud-based data sharing and analysis platform. It is interoperable with other data platforms, providing data hosting, collaborative workspaces, and supporting federated data sharing.

### What is Federated and Distributed Sharing Appliance (FDSA)
The **Federated Data Sharing Appliance (FDSA)** is an integral component within the AD Workbench product suite. It provides a foundation for secure data sharing and collaboration, empowering the research community by unlocking access to previously unreachable datasets. The Linux-based system facilitates interoperability across platforms, especially in scenarios where direct data sharing is not feasible. Data owners can add their dataset metadata to the AD Workbench, allowing Workbench users to request access to discover, select, and perform remote federated analysis on a wide variety of protected datasets.

### Key Features
- Allows organizations or entities to **securely and collaboratively share data** while retaining governance over their own data sources.
- Offers granular control over data access with **enhanced data privacy** as a fundamental feature.
- Provides a **streamlined system** for reviewing data access requests and query management process.

### Get started with FDSA

**For Data Owners:** FDSA is easily installed within the data owner's infrastructure/server environment, ensuring a seamless integration process. Data owners have access to a user-friendly UI that empowers them to manage secure data uploads, operations, access, and maintenance effortlessly.

**For Data Users:** Within the AD Workbench, researchers can explore metadata from private datasets, request access to specific datasets of interest, and query remote data for analysis within their workspacesâ€”maximizing the potential for groundbreaking research on data from around the world.

### Why FDSA
- Data owners and researchers currently lack a secure and efficient platform for discovering, sharing, and leveraging datasets to unleash their full potential. FDSA aims to address this gap, supporting the quest for treatments and solutions related to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

### Who can benefit?
- **Data Providers**: Organizations and Research Centers that possess valuable datasets and seek to expedite the research process.
- **Data Researchers**: Individuals and organizations in search of datasets to support, learn from, enhance, ignite, justify, and amplify their research.

## Purpose and Mission

### Primary Objective
FDSA serves as a standalone node in a federated network, allowing data controllers to set up secure data sharing infrastructure while maintaining strict control over their data. The core purpose is to enable collaborative research without compromising data privacy or violating data use agreements.

### ADDI's Vision
ADDI envisions a future where open data and global collaborations power the end of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. FDSA accelerates the development of new treatments by enabling researchers worldwide to access, use, and share dementia-related data securely and efficiently.

## Key Features
