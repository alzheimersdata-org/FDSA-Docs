## Overview

The **Federated Data Sharing Appliance (FDSA)** is a Linux-based production implementation of the [Common API](https://github.com/federated-data-sharing/common-api/blob/master/doc/API_Overview.md) standards for remote querying and computation in distributed research environments. Developed by the **Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative (ADDI)**, FDSA enables secure federated research on highly sensitive datasets where data use agreements prevent data movement or direct access.

## Purpose and Mission

### Primary Objective
FDSA serves as a standalone node in a federated network, allowing data controllers to set up secure data sharing infrastructure while maintaining strict control over their data. The core purpose is to enable collaborative research without compromising data privacy or violating data use agreements.

### ADDI's Vision
ADDI envisions a future where open data and global collaborations power the end of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. FDSA accelerates the development of new treatments by enabling researchers worldwide to access, use, and share dementia-related data securely and efficiently.

## Key Features

### Data Access Levels

FDSA supports two distinct levels of data access:

#### Level 1: Record-Level Data Access
- **Purpose**: Direct querying and retrieval of individual records
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Remote querying with record-level data return
  - Direct data access for approved researchers
  - Real-time data exploration capabilities
- **Use Cases**: Exploratory data analysis, data validation, preliminary research

#### Level 2: Summary/Analysis-Level Data Access
- **Purpose**: Secure computation on data without direct record access
- **Capabilities**:
  - Remote querying with summary/analysis results only
  - Containerized analysis execution
  - Results review and approval workflow
- **Use Cases**: Statistical analysis, machine learning, collaborative research

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Data Access Request Management
- **FAIR Integration**: Seamless integration with ADWB FAIR Data Access Requests
- **Workflow Support**: Complete lifecycle management from request to approval/denial
- **Automated Processing**: Support for automatic approval workflows
- **Review System**: Comprehensive review and approval mechanisms

#### 2. User Management
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Built-in mobile authenticator 2FA
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission system (administrator, superadmin, standard user, requester)
- **Auto-User Creation**: Automatic user account creation upon data access request approval
- **User Actions**: Complete user lifecycle management (create, update, disable, role changes)

#### 3. Security Features
- **Encryption**: End-to-end data encryption for sensitive information
- **Token Management**: Secure access token generation and validation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all system activities
- **IP Validation**: Network-level access controls

#### 4. Data Source Management
- **Database Connectors**: Easy integration with various data sources
- **Athena Support**: AWS Athena integration for cloud-based data
- **PostgreSQL**: Built-in PostgreSQL database with external connection support
- **Docker Registry**: Azure Docker Registry connector for Level 2 analysis

#### 5. Task and Query Management
- **Job States**: Complete workflow tracking (Queued, Initializing, Running, Quarantined, Approved/Rejected, Complete/Rejected)
- **Query History**: Comprehensive logging of all data queries
- **Result Management**: Secure handling and delivery of analysis results

## Integration Capabilities

### FAIR Data Platform Integration
FDSA integrates seamlessly with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data platform:
- **Automated DAR Processing**: Receives and processes data access requests from FAIR
- **Callback System**: Real-time status updates back to FAIR
- **Webhook Support**: Configurable webhooks for external system integration
- **Trust Synchronization**: Maintains trust status alignment between systems

### Query Builder Integration
- **ADDI Query Builder**: Web-based interface for building and executing federated queries
- **GraphQL Support**: Advanced query capabilities through GraphQL
- **CSV/Excel Export**: Multiple output formats for analysis results

## Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Institutional Research
Enable collaborative research across multiple institutions while maintaining data sovereignty and compliance with local regulations.

### 2. Clinical Trial Data Analysis
Secure analysis of clinical trial data without moving sensitive patient information across institutional boundaries.

### 3. Epidemiological Studies
Large-scale population studies using federated data from multiple healthcare systems.

### 4. Drug Discovery
Accelerate drug discovery by enabling secure access to diverse datasets across research institutions.

### 5. Regulatory Compliance
Meet strict regulatory requirements for data handling in healthcare and research environments.
