## Unattended Installation

If you prefer an unattended installation, fill in the 'Database Credentials' sections in the `.env` file with your preferred configuration. For example:

```env
PGHOST='fdsa-database.postgres.database.com'
PGDATABASE='fdsa_database'
PGUSER='fdsa_user'
PGPASSWORD='fdsa_pass'
```

Then, run one of the following lines based on your database choice:

- **For an external database:**
  ```bash
  printf 'yes\nyes\n' | bash ubuntu-startup.sh host.example.com
  ```
- **For a local database:**
  ```bash
  printf 'yes\nno\n' | bash ubuntu-startup.sh host.example.com
  ```
